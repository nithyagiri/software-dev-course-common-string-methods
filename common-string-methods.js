Practice Problem #1

Activity 1: Searching Strings
Write a program to:
Check if the text "JavaScript" is in the string "Learning JavaScript is fun!" using includes.
Find the position of the word "fun" in the string.

Activity 2: Transforming Strings
Convert the string " CODE BOOTCAMP " to lowercase and remove all extra whitespace.
Replace "BOOTCAMP" with "JavaScript" in the transformed string.

Activity 3: Breaking Apart a Sentence
Split the sentence "Coding is fun and educational" into an array of words.

Activity 4: Retrieving Substrings
Retrieve the first character of "Bootcamp" using charAt.
Extract the word "camp" from "Bootcamp" using slice.

Advanced Challenge
Write a program to process the following string:
Customer: John Doe
Order: Apple, Banana, Grape
Total: $20.50
Extract the customer name.
Split the order into an array of items.
Convert the total price to uppercase (e.g., "TOTAL: $20.50").

Practice Problem #2

Objective
Practice using common string methods to manipulate and extract information from strings.

Instructions:
You are tasked with processing a single string and
performing a series of operations using the string methods covered in the lesson.
Each task corresponds to one or more methods and can be completed independently.

String to Use:
  let inputString = "  Welcome to the Coding Bootcamp! Learn JavaScript today.  ";

Tasks:
Complete the following tasks and assign the results to the specified variables. Log each result to the console.

1. Searching
  - Check if the word "JavaScript" is in the string using includes and assign the result to a variable named hasJavaScript.
  - Find the position of the word "Coding" in the string using indexOf and assign the result to a variable named codingPosition.
  - Check if the string starts with "Welcome" using startsWith and assign the result to a variable named startsWithWelcome.
  - Check if the string ends with "today." using endsWith and assign the result to a variable named endsWithToday.

2. Transforming
  - Convert the string to all lowercase letters using toLowerCase and assign the result to a variable named lowercaseString.
  - Convert the string to all uppercase letters using toUpperCase and assign the result to a variable named uppercaseString.
  - Remove the extra spaces from the beginning and end of the string using trim and assign the result to a variable named trimmedString.
  - Replace the word "JavaScript" with "coding" using replace and assign the result to a variable named replacedString.

3. Breaking Apart
  - Split the string into an array of words using split with a space (" ") as the delimiter and assign the result to a variable named wordsArray.

4. Retrieving
  - Retrieve the first character of the trimmed string using charAt and assign the result to a variable named firstCharacter.
  - Extract the word "Bootcamp" from the string using slice and assign the result to a variable named extractedBootcamp

//Starter Code
let inputString = "  Welcome to the Coding Bootcamp! Learn JavaScript today.  ";



// 1. Searching
let hasJavaScript = inputString.includes("JavaScript") ;// Your code here
let codingPosition = inputString.indexOf("Coding");
let startsWithWelcome = inputString.startsWith("Welcome"); // Your code here
let endsWithToday = inputString.endsWith("today."); // Your code here

// 2. Transforming
let lowercaseString = inputString.toLowerCase(); // Your code here
let uppercaseString = inputString.toUpperCase(); // Your code here
let trimmedString = inputString.trim();//Your code here
let replacedString = inputString.replace("JavaScript","coding"); // Your code here

// 3. Breaking Apart
let wordsArray = inputString.split(" ");// Your code here                  

// 4. Retrieving
let firstCharacter = inputString.trim().charAt(0); // Your code here
let extractedBootcamp = inputString.slice(17,23); // Your code here

// Log all results
console.log({
  hasJavaScript,
  codingPosition,
  startsWithWelcome,
  endsWithToday,
  lowercaseString,
  uppercaseString,
  trimmedString,
  replacedString,
  wordsArray,
